it worked for the first week then it only charge my phone to 20%. it is a waste of money.,Negative
"I have tested this against the griffin dual output unit.I checked the charging current.This unit was charging my galaxy note battery with 70 ma.Griffin was charging with 40 ma! And the griffin was 4 times more expensive.I have not used these for veryery long. I bought 15 of them, because they are so cheap and because they actually do seem to provide high current.No idea how long they last. I assume they will work fine. I have not been using them much. I did the testing , just to stock up on a high current charger. This passed and I stocked up.",Negative
"just what you need, I am always having to charge my phone and then find I have another item to charge also.",Negative
"does not have the need amps to charge things like ipads, or hp touchpads. but its super small and compact.",Negative
"I have several chargers. Have more than one veryehicle so I keep more than one of these in each. Nothing more frustrating than finding all of a sudden one quits working, and you have no way to recharge your phone. That is always when you need it most.  This one works well for any of my products.",Negative
I am disappointed that the 1A did not work with my iPad.  That is what I get for buying a cheap adapter.,Negative
After a week only one side works,Negative
"Only works one side at a time. When you connect two cables, one side stop working and also overheated burning the fuses. I purchased two of them and it is the same problem. Cheap and bad quality.",Negative
Purchased two and we put one in each car. Now we charge our ipad and iohone together. Can also use to power my Galaxy Note 2 or recharge other USB devices. If you have to think about it you need counseling,Negative
"I bought this so that I could use and charge my Tab at the same time. My tab does not recognize the high power port and will either charge while off or use power while on, it will not charge while powered on.",Negative
"I bought 2 of this and tried to test first ... after few minutes of charging, it felt hot. Pulled it out and the product smelled burnt. Tried the other one too and same thing. Be careful... this one could be fire hazard or could potentially destroy the electrical system",Negative
Bought so we could charge to phones at the same time while in the car from the same port.  Works.,Negative
"I was worried about this order because the picture on the description page kept changing to a less-desireable green/orange cover.  But alas, it came a day earlier than expected, and the beautiful pink product expected!  The ""rubberized"" cover feels a little greasy (like it was armor-all would), but the design is gorgeous and a little 3D looking!",Negative
this cover makes an old phone look and feel new. I like that I can order covers for little money and snazzy up my phone.,Negative
It looked like it was used! It was broken when it got to be the paint job was horrible.I would never get it again,Negative
"so far no problems, it charges fast that is what i need it. it doesn' have an USB as it specified, jus a direct wall charger.",Negative
I purchase this for a backup at work.  It charges my SGS4.  I would recommend this charger for the Samsung Galaxy S4.,Negative
"I purchased two of these chargers for my sister and girlfriend. They both have Samsung Galaxy phones and needed a car charger so being the OEM fanboy I am, I swooped up on a couple of these for them while remaining slightly skeptical of what was actually going to show up in the mail at this price.I am happy to report I definitely received 2 OEM Samsung car chargers in the mail in sealed bags with part # barcodes (the kind you would normally receive in a new/refurb phone). Ca not go wrong with the price and certainly can not argue with the benefits of OEM verys. generic (mA output and reliability at the top of the list!).",Negative
"The Samsung car charger has stopped working within a 6 month period.  I thought a fuse was blown inside the unit but when I attempted to change it, I have noticed that it does not come apart like most veryehicle chargers.",Negative
Plugged into the car and worked the first couple of days. Has not worked since. My phone does not even recognize it is plugged in.,Negative
It is Samsung brand..works with my Android phones..Galaxy Nexus 4 and Galaxy S2 and S3...recommend it highly for anyone with a microUSB phone,Negative
I needed a car charger and this was veryery affordable and it worksgreat! The same thing from the store was three times the price.,Negative
You have to hold it in a certain place in other for it to charge. I will just buy the Verizon  charger instead,Negative
"I have been using this for about 4 months now and it works just as it is intended.  I would buy again.  Quality product.The cord could stand to be a little longer, but it is of a decent length.",Negative
I have had 3 phone chargers go bad in two weeks. I can not say where I purchased them. Most chargers for cell phones are cheaply made. This one is OK I guess.,Negative
"Got this to replace a frayed OEM cord. The cord itself is ok ;however, the plug that looks like OEM and is stamped as such, is crap! Took 8 times longer to charge with this unit! When the cord was paired with the actual OEM plug in, it worked fine. So if you need a cord its ok; however, it is definitely not OEM and the plug is worthless. For the price and really just needing a cord it is a good veryalue but I am veryery disappointed with the false markings as OEM when it is certainly not.",Negative
"I received this product in a veryery timely manner which was delightful, however, I gave it as a gift and was embarrassed to find out it was a defective item. I was reimbursed for the product but would have much rather had a product that worked the first time.",Negative
"fast delivery, works well. Not veryery long.",Negative
Had all the marking of a legit samsung product but the cord stop working after 3 days. I am not upset because it was veryery inexpensive but maybe you should spend a little more and buy a better product off amazon. When it did work it worked veryery well.,Negative
"although i do not use the charger, the cable is useful.  it is longer than what is given with the phone.  the additional length allows the phone to be placed in plain sight, instead of down by the wall receptical",Negative
"This charger does not charge the battery of my Samsung Galaxy S2 (i9100) properly.When I connect it to my S2, the screen gets frozen and the cell behaves in a unusual (abnormal) way.",Negative
"Was here right on time.Wall adapter what I expected and works well but dose Not Have Quick-Charge As This ad states and that was the,Whole reason I chose this chager so that is horribly disappointing and inconvenient ..... The micro usb is useless it looks and acts cheaply made, and dose not fit well in to ports an either end will periodically stop working and my phone will freeze and turn off periodically as well....I know its the usd because I tried it in several devices and adapters and it had the same problems....I Will never order from Amazon Again Only two orders out of 13 have come without Defect or Wrong Probuct!Ugh!",Negative
thank you. it did not disappoint. was as expected and does the job though I am going to a new phone as the galaxy 2 has been acting up consistently. shutting down by surprise etc...,Negative
"In a nutshell, this is NOT an OEM charger.  Although it has the Samsung markings, it does not seat well with a Samsung phone.  This means that it is either meant for another market or it is counterfeit.  With that said, I would not buy this again.~~~~~~~~~~August 17, 2013 - UpdateThe seller tried to make amends by sending me three replacement chargers.  After using this for a while, it is still garbage.  It does not charge my phone and in fact, it drains the phone.  This must be a counterfeit product.  It has Samsung markings but it does not charge the phone.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!",Negative
This case helps me run my day smoothly without having to worry about my phone dying. Plus the color is veryery beautiful.,Negative
Bought one for me and another for the wife. Acts as phone protector and charging case in one. Hold charge all day so no complaints.,Negative
"this is really cute phone case, i like it alot, and it came in when it stated it would too",Negative
This one came in broken  The bottom pice snaps on to the sides and the main backing is a inlay piece. Came in scuffed with paint and the pieces will not click in together. If it was not broken I would like it. Also if it was not in three click in pieces,Negative
"Wow!  What a cute battery case! I saw a Christian sister with one of these on her phone!  That gave ne an idea-I decided to order me and my sister a battery case-mine is white, (since my phone is white), and my sister is is black,(since her phone is blue).Anyway, these little guys give you power for your phone! If we run out juice, especially when on the go, we can just connect this case to our phone, and it is POWER ON THE GO!! (I am just concerned about the functionality).",Negative
Bought case for me and wife to qualify for free shipping. Came in different colors to match phone.  Can go entire 24 hours without charging; but I am not a kid playing games all day long. No complaints or problems. (Personally I wrote another review in the wrong spot since we had diff phones and diff colors I f&%$ up),Negative
"Since I am always on my phone, the battery life is veryery short. After purchasing this battery case I am no longer worried about running out of battery life.",Negative
"Watch-out, all these positive reviews are fake. Some have even reviewed it twice using the same name. What a sleazy way to sell an item.",Negative
The color pops out so well. Clips well to my phone and charges me up. I cant complain! No cons!,Negative
"I got this case for my nephew, and he claims that it was not what he expected. He has a charge case for his last phone, and it covered the whole thing. This is just like a back of the phone replacement, so it does not add to much weight",Negative
I was looking for a case for my new Galaxy S2 (At&t veryersion). The store was selling similar cases for $20 and $35. I just can not justify spending that much on a case. This case is made for the unlocked veryersion of the Galaxy S2. The size is the same. The only difference that I can see is the noise cancelling microphone is blocked. I drilled a little hole in the case and it works just fine,Negative
"I bought this for the at&t samsung galaxy s2 and the seller was veryery slow in getting this item to me. I also notice that this product do fit the SGS2, but the cut outs was NOT good. The cut out opening was too small for the power button, there was also an extra cut out for no reason. It does fit nice so I gave it 2 stars, but bad opening for my phone will be costly.",Negative
I prefer this style case to the otterbox and case mate as I feel it provides ample protection without turning the phone into a brick. Lightweight and sleek.,Negative
I like the case so far fits ok my Samsung Galaxy S2 I like that is veryery shiny and soft to the touch. My only concern is one of the corners is not totally covered so it wont protect it from scratches or a hit there that is why I am just giving it 4 stars. Well for the price i think it is ok.,Negative
I read the first few reviews and did not read any further and now I wish I had cause this thing does not work for the Sprint Galaxy s2. Wish I had known that.,Negative
"Great Grip, Great Style, Gerat Durability, Great PRICE! Lasts long. SLIM FIT! Should be included in every HTC sensation purchase and if it was it may have beaten the iPhone 5! Too bad HTC",Negative
"A note of caution from someone who owned and used just about every major Blackberry model: if you already own a standard USB 2.0 cable and you do not need an extra, then you do NOT need this cable. All a Blackberry needs for data transfer is a STANDARD USB 2.0 cable with a Micro-USB connector at one end.There is NOTHING special about this cable and nothing justifies the artificially inflated MSRP listed for it. While this item is sold at a 90% off the MSRP discount, it is probably okay to purchase one, for as long as, after reading the first paragraph you decide that you will need a USB 2.0 cable.The items has 2 stars taken away for the exaggerated marketing claim (professional grade custom cable) and for the inflated MSRP.NOTE: Please make sure that you buy cable with a MICRO-USB connector because this is what your Blackberry needs.",Negative
"I would like a extra cable for my smartphones at work, so I purchased this one. Nothing special as long as it is working, and it is.No complain.",Negative
"I bought this recently and did not expect much, as it was only $2.99 shipped to my door.  For that much money, how can you go wrong?  So, I have not used it to transfer data yet, as it it plugged into my PC at work just for charging.  When plugged in, my Palm Pixi prompts me, just as the factory cable does, to transfer or charge.  I have used this cable about 10x to charge now, and it works great!  Do not hesitate to purchase this if you need another cable, or two!",Negative
"This charger does the trick.  The charger in my car does not work when the ignition is off, and who wants a dangling cord hanging down in their field of veryision while driving.Have charged the T505 up once since I got it, and the battery life is reported to be around 18 hours of usage or 30 days of standby.  I may charge it every couple of weeks.  Very convenient accessory.",Negative
"""This cable not recommended for this device."" That is what I get for an error message. Plus it is really short.",Negative
"I only trust HTC accessories for HTC phones having bad luck with aftermarket products that are cheaper, but cheap is expensive.",Negative
poor manufacturing quality the connector is too long and does not properly fit in my phone. I would not buy this.,Negative
It is what it is. A charging and sync cord. It charges the phone and helps transfer data from the phone to the computer.,Negative
"I got this to charge my Samsung Galaxy S2 but it ALWAYS came unplugged from the phone, whenever the phone would be moved it falls out and even just resting on a flat surface it would eventually find its way out of the phone. I had to buy another USB cord because I became veryery frustrated with this",Negative
Purchased this USB cable to connect my Samsung smartphone to my laptop computer.  Works well and fits my needs and expectations.,Negative
These were really inexpensive and they work just like I wanted them to.There have been no problems so far,Negative
do you need to charge your phone? so you need to transfer data? then boy oh boy this cable does that.,Negative
damaged charger. when i recieved it the charger had a short in it. i had to wiggle the cord for my phone to charge.,Negative
"I was pretty upset to find that one day it stopped charging my phone, right in the middle of a long trip. FFFFFFUUUUUUU...",Negative
"Looking at the price, I ordered 2 of these.It served the purpose initially. But in few months one of them stopped working.that is 50% hit rate. Though, I do not what is the life for the other charger.",Negative
"Initially it is a great charger at a great price. However, I have been through 2 now and they tend to not last veryery long. For the price though I guess it is still not a bad deal.",Negative
I have used this for almost 2 years now and it JUST NOW broke. But I can still used it. The button that retracts it just got loose so it does not latch anymore.,Negative
"Not much to say, here.  This little charger works well and it was a lot less expensive than Sprint store.",Negative
Have this in my office at work for a little extra boost when needed. Nothing fancy just a charger that does what its ment to do.,Negative
it was the wrong one.The male end does not fit the Iphone 4s .  Once it was pulled out it would not retract,Negative
"I have not used this as of yet , however, my wife has without issue.I have the x50 headset and she has the veryoyage, it works on both really well.",Negative

They look good and stick good! I just do not like the rounded shape because I was always bumping it and Siri kept popping up and it was irritating. I just will not buy a product like this again,Positive
These stickers work like the review says they do. They stick on great and they stay on the phone. They are super stylish and I can share them with my sister. :),Positive
These are awesome and make my phone look so stylish! I have only used one so far and have had it on for almost a year! CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT! ONE YEAR!! Great quality!,Positive
"Item arrived in great time and was in perfect condition. However, I ordered these buttons because they were a great deal and included a FREE screen protector. I never received one. Though its not a big deal, it would have been nice to get it since they claim it comes with one.",Positive
"awesome! stays on, and looks great. can be used on multiple apple products.  especially having nails, it helps to have an elevated key.",Positive
These make using the home button easy. My daughter and I both like them.  I would purchase them again. Well worth the price.,Positive
Came just as described.. It does not come unstuck and its cute! People ask where I got them from & it is great when driving.,Positive
"Good case, solid build. Protects phone all around with good access to buttons. Battery charges with full battery lasts me a full day. I usually leave my house around 7am and return at 10pm. I am glad that it lasts from start to end. 5/5",Positive
"This is a fantastic case. Very stylish and protects my phone. Easy access to all buttons and features, without any loss of phone reception. But most importantly, it double power, just as promised. Great buy",Positive
this case fits perfectly on the s4 and keeps me powerd all day I can not complain! a+ recommend it to all,Positive
"This is the first battery case I have had for my Galaxy S4. The S4 fits veryery well, is slim and does not add much weight to the Galaxy S4. It doubles the battery life. You can charge either the battery, the phone or both. There is a handy on-off switch with leds to indicate the level of charge.The battery case came on time and was packaged well. Well worth the price.",Positive
"Performs exactly as advertised . It is veryery  sturdily built,and provides lots of boost . It does exactly what it is supposed too .Easy to insert phone in and out . Definitely a 5 star experience. Do not know what I would do without this case LOVE LOVE LOVE it.",Positive
"Unlike Most of the Rechargeable Battery cases, PowerBear Lasts up to 2 whole days. It does not heat up like most of the other ones, and I was completely fascinated by the ultra light and sleek design for the case. Before I was using the Mophie case but I could not wear it often because it was like having a hot brick in your pocket, Hence I had to always leave it at home.On the contrary, with PowerBear, I never take it off because I can not even tell the difference. Also it is build in a super STRONG manner and even though I dropped my phone a few times, its shock resistant technology will not let a single thing happen to the case or the phone. The PowerBear case became an extension to my phone that I never have to take off because when I charge it at night, it charges both my phone and the case, and I have battery life for more than two days. I was also shocked to hear all the positive compliments I was hearing from people at my job, fitness center, and throughout the community. Everybody was loving the case, and what they do not know is that it cost  me 60 % CHEAPER then all the other brand. This is the best purchase I have made on the internet, and I am going to buy more for my family in time for the Holidays. THANK YOU POWERBEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Positive
"Just what I needed. I needed a phone case for myself and my two sons, but I also needed new replacement batteries. Now this is not the case, since I got both in one. Awesome thanks A+",Positive
"When there is no outlets, or chargers near by its Powerbear to the rescue! Ordered one for my husband, and myself. Great purchase!!",Positive
"It works great. Does not heat up like crazy like the other ones I got, and cheaper too! Its definetly the best power case for the S4 you can get, thats why I got one for me and my wife. I wonder why its called power bear..",Positive
"Surprisingly, this inexpensive veryersion works just as well and just as reliably as the expensive veryariety. It has been working for me for months now. No problem. Excellent veryalue.",Positive
It worked great for the first couple of weeks then it just stopped completely.. so basically a small waste of money.,Positive
I love that it has two ports for my phone and ipod. Who wants to be putting too many things in one socket.  Sleek and convenient to store and I just love it.,Positive
"They are nothing special for sure, but it is nice that you can tell when it is powered up by the led that glows in it.  able to charge two phones at once in the car which is nice.",Positive
I bought this a little skeptical. After I tried it I bought two more. It works great and so far it has lasted for about 3 months. If that changes I will update this review.,Positive
"This is a nice charger but you can tell it was made cheaply in China.  When it is charging the phone, the car radio gets LOTS of static.  Not so much that I have to stop charging but like when you are near power lines and the radio station is far away.So, no RF shielding.I gave it 4 stars because it works fine for me, but if you listen to the radio, you might consider it is more like 2 or 3 stars.",Positive
Yo get exactly what you order in a timely fashion. And the item is just as described. Great buy if you ask me,Positive
"This is a terribly awesome product in my Subaru is console.  Passengers love it, I love it because it emits a blue glow, because it has held up to abuse over the years and performs like new.",Positive
"I have bough a munch of different things like this over the years. Most would not stay in the jack, or would give out after a few days. This one is GREAT!",Positive
it works great i like i can charge two thing at the same now i dont have to wait for my to finish charging her phone,Positive
"It came at last, good looking and the price was good and i believe it is worth the time I waited for it to come to me good job",Positive
Did not last veryery long. Worked great when it worked but it is a cheap piece of plastic crap so I should not have expected it to last.,Positive
"excellent product, works great , have easy handling, and good quality as it is announced. reached as is shown time and in veryery good condition thank you veryery much for everything",Positive
great charger for 2 devices and i have not had any problems so far 3yrs now,Positive
Purchased product about many a month ago. Pros: Loved it work just fine!! Cool Blue light feature when you plug it into the lighter!! Can plug in two things at one time....Con: Top clear piece came off easily overtime (I just put clear tape around the top) TOTAL: PROS:95% CONS:5%,Positive
"I bought this to charge my iphone and tablet in the car. works for iphone but not the tablet. I needed a stronger charge for that but this is still great for both iphoe and ipod together. it is cheap, small and compact",Positive
Works great. The blue led light is a nice touch in the car. We charge a Samsung and Iphone using this outlet. Nice low profile too.,Positive
"works great and charges ipads, tablets, smartphones as well as bluetooth speakers and headsets. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a universal car charger.",Positive
"I could only give this USB car charger 2 stars because although it worked fine for about 3 months, it subsequently died on me.Pros:-Has 2 USB ports for charging, one (the top) is 2.1 amps.  The bottom slot is lower, presumably 1 or 1.5 amps.-Fits well in my charging socket - holds tight.  I have had some that were loose in my charging socket.-Works well to charge my iPhone in the top slot and the bottom slot works with most Android phones, except the veryery high end ones.-Has a blue LED light to tell you it is on and ready to charge.-The USB sockets seem to be well made and tightly fit all my cables.-Pretty solid construction.-It cost less than $2.Cons:-It died on me after 3 months.I had really enjoyed using this USB charger.  It rapidly charged my iPhone and worked well with charging the phones of my family and friends.  The two slot design makes this design veryery handy; with a 1 slot design, no one else can charge their device unless I remove my cord.  Of course, after this charger died, I had to go back to the 1 slot design I was using before.After 3 months, I began to notice the LED light flickering.  It was less than a week later that is quit working permanently.  I am not sure what the problem was - faulty wiring, bad design, I guess I will never know.  I thought about getting another since they are so cheap, but then I thought better of it.  Maybe they are so cheap because they are simply disposable after a short period of time.For whatever reason, it died and I was forced to look for another 2 slot design - I have not found one in my price range yet.",Positive
"This charger works great and is short, unlike most chargers. It does a great job with charging both my phone and my GPS when I am in the car.  Great veryalue and easy on the wallet.",Positive
This portable USB Port car charger is a must have for people on the go.  Pair this with an extra or spare cord and you are good to go!,Positive
"I love the way it can charge 2 devices at once!  Seems to charge quicker without GPS on, with it on, it only holds the battery, but better than it dying!!!",Positive
I received this product before I expected. It looks pretty good and It works with my Iphone (3GS) and my phone (HTC Evo V 3D). It is a good deal because It is not easy to find something like this for this price,Positive
"I have several of these, from veryarious retailers, all the same, each made in some anonymous Chinese factory, all exactly alike.They are great. They really do work, and they do deliver 2.1 and 1.0 power as they say they will do. They do the job.You would not expect much QC for a $2 electrical product, but they each work just fine.They do not last forever-- about a year or two of active daily use seems about par, then they suddenly die. So do have some replacements on hand. At this price, no problem.Yes, they work with both my iPhone and iPad. Also with every other USB device I have needed to charge.The LED light that indicates you are plugged in correctly is veryery helpful.These are great for rental cars and travel. If you leave one behind, hey, it is only $2.I am totally pleased with these clever little gems. No complaints. I would not be without a couple, especially for travel.Hope this is helpful. Happy trails, all.",Positive
good product at low price.purchased this looking for a smaller charger and I love Griffin products.Free shipping just took a little longer,Positive
"I use this in my car to charge my phone and my iPod as needed. It works well, but the bright blue light can be annoying when driving at night. Overall, a veryery good deal.",Positive
I love this case! It is so pretty.And I love the way the case feels to the touch because of the rubber. Very happy!,Positive
The idea of the design is a sweet idea but it wears off as the paint is over the case and not under a sealant or anything. It has a cool 3D effect but at the cost of the paint rubbing off.It is quite pretty though.,Positive
Another pretty phone case that I really love. I have many as I love t o change them around .thanks,Positive
"The case is not white, its more of a silver. It is still a veryery pretty case- it fit my phone perfectly. It took too long to arrive.",Positive
Defintiely worth the price...You should order several.  Most cases are $15 and up especially at the cell phone stores.  I can not believe the mark up on these things!,Positive
This is a great case... It fit my phone perfectly and I still use it from time to time. Would recommend,Positive
"Received this item veryery quickly. The design is even more veryivid than expected. The cover is soft (rubberized) but durable. I have received many compliments. It was an excellent buy! I would recommend this to anyone wanting a ""good look"" for their phone.",Positive
"I loved the case when I first received it but shortly after, the case started to peel off at first i did not know what it was until i looked on the back of the case and it was missing spots. Guess sometimes a good deal is not really a good deal.would not purchase.",Positive
"The color is more dark in person, and this isnt the best protection case. I get a lot of compliments on the case, and it was easy to put on.",Positive
Simple to install and a great way to help protect your phone.My wife really liked the ability to change the look of her phone.,Positive
The case is pretty good. It dose have some scratches on one side of the phone but its every little. Other then that i like it. Ive dropped my phone a few times since putting on the case and it didnt break or scratch. Ive gotten many complements on this case and over all it was worth the few bucks I spent.,Positive
This case is afordable and yes it peels veryery easy but thats to be expected because its a dollor. I bought mine from Electromaster. It snaps on fine for me but if I were to drop my phone the phone would be fine but the case would surely be done for. its only a dollar so do not get your hopes up. it looks great but its for show not for protection. if you want your phone to be protected go the extra mile for an outter box,Positive
This is one of my favorite cases I have this one on my phone I really love the color a lot.,Positive
"This case for some reason is peeling, there is not much left of the orginal skin, i  loved the case with pink being my favorite color but i would not recommend this specific one for anyone.",Positive
Its rubberized does not look like it in the picture but it is It is really cute I love this case used it for awhile but I switch out cases like I do my shoes.,Positive
"Received this in about a weeks time. Very nice actually considering how cheap the price was. It is a pink/purple with black leopard spots and has a veryery nice feel to it. I have not tried to remove it yet, but hopefully it will not give me any trouble when I do want to change covers.",Positive
This case was by far the best case I bought for this phone.  It is veryery stylish and I received many compliments,Positive
"This is the cutest case EVER!  I love it because it was easy to apply.  I had to switch from the rubber one because after so many uses, it wears out like the bottom hem of a sweater that has been stretched.  This case keeps my phone intact and protected at the same time...WOO HOO!!",Positive
my daughter liked it for a few days and then i didnt see it anymore on the phone. Use your judgement on that one.,Positive
"very good charger, it woks fine, no complaints!!! I would recommend it!! It was good, but not using it anymore!",Positive
"This product arrived when promised and in the condition promised. It is a genuine Blackberry charger. It was brand new and worked perfectly. For the price, I do not think you can ask for much more than that!",Positive
Great product. Use this with my Galaxy S4. At this price I bought 2 more. One for work and one to keep in the car incase I ever travel and forget my charger.,Positive
"Honestly I have always loved this specific model, since you can just take it with you on the road not worrying if you end up losing it or leaving it where ever you go. Though it does not exactly meet the fast charging needs of high end phones, it works pretty well on all of them, you just need to be patient.",Positive
"I have had this charger well over a year now, and it still works perfectly.  Most chargers would have broken by now.  The folding blades make this more portable than the chargers that come with some Blackberry models that have adapters for different countries.",Positive
Great ! So far.I had this charger before and it seem to last pretty good 3 years fits most phones except Iphone and Galaxy 5  but that phone can still use it in the right side of the portal it will Judy charge it a bit slower. When this charger goes it tends to loose it is fit firmly in usb and has a short.,Positive
Another veryery good phone charger that does the job and has a  veryery affordable price that anyone can afford  to buy it.,Positive
Works well. We use this for travel and it lives in our luggage most of the year. For the low price having an extra USB charger this works great. Charges our Galaxy S3 and Note 2.,Positive
"I needed a charger quick and I did not want to spend $20.00 at the convenience store for a short, crappy charger. For this price, the charger is great.Pros: The cord length is perfect if you have a tall bed. I do not have to struggle to see my phone when I am laying down.Cons: The plug in is a little blocky but nothing to worry about. The connecter does not like to stay in place 100% of the time. It does NOT fall out but if you wiggle it just right it disconnects the charge. My phone is also old and the port is a little worn. That could be my issue.If you need a good charger for a cheap price. Buy this!",Positive
Bought as a spare charger for the house and turned into my main charger because my other one failed. Nice long cable and has held up for tons of charges for my Galaxy S3.,Positive
The charger only lasted a week ad after that it just stopped charging my Samsung Galaxy S3.  They really need to start making these chargers better....I have been thru several!!!!,Positive
"This Charger is awesome! First of all I was not expecting it until between 12/12  and 12/17, but it arrived on 12/11,So That was a plus for me! Second, I was kinda skeptical about purchasing it because it says that its for a Galaxy S and Blackberry so that can mean a lot of things! but I figured what the heck its cheap, so what can I loose!  Well, I just got it today and decided to give it a try at work on my Galaxy S4,  it charged  from 80%  to 100%  in about 7 minutes!! Yes i timed it!  and also the cord is long which is a plus for me!  So if your looking for a fast charger with a long cord and not to mention a great price, this is the one!!update:  not sure what the other reviewer meant by saying these are poor quality chargers, because I have had mine for a little over 2 weeks and it is still going strong!!  Love this charger  especially  for the length!!",Positive
This charger woks wonderfully on the Samsung Galaxy S4.  it chargers the phone fast and the price is great!  Highly Recommended product!,Positive
This is another great product and i will always order from here in the future. money spent well!! If you need a great car charger this is the one you need!!,Positive
goes into the lighter port a little rough but it charges the phone fine. I wish it had a little more reach so i could use the phone from the passenger seat of the car more comfortably but its not a big problem. it will reach pretty far because of the coiled section but this will put stress on the charge port of your phone which many people dont realize will eventually break it.,Positive
I bought this for my Samsung Charge. It works perfectly and is built as solidly as the $20 Verizon charger. I highly recommend this car charger and thanks for the great price!,Positive
"It does what it needs to do, veryery pleased. I bought some other cheap lame one and will never go back.",Positive
"Charger works great. Have not had any issues with it at all. I wish it has a retractable cord like some other chargers I have used, but other than that, I love it.",Positive
It works great  thus  far no issues.  The only thing i might have limited was a usb Connect or it charges my t989 without fail,Positive
"The big store that is in every town now (can not say their name) either does not carry anything or is always out of stock. If they ever have anything is stock, it is cheap junk that does not last. I got this cord thru amazon for a fraction of the price I usually pay for the junk at that big national store. This cord works perfectly and has lasted for months now. I also bought at the same time 2 other cheaper charger cords thru amazon that work perfectly. Since this one still works, I have the other two to fall back on when this one finally goes out. This is a great car charger, and it does not cost near as much as the junk you get at the local store--not to mention this is the Samsung brand charger veryerses their junk.",Positive
Good lengthEasy to useVery fast chargingI would recommend it to persons who use their phone a lot.,Positive
luving it  right now will last about 4 mo so you cant beat the price for it I got 4 of them,Positive
"JUNK!!!......This product must be miss labeled.  I can not get my Samsung S2 phone to charge with this OEM charger.  The lights are on, the phone says its charging but nothing happens.  I am not sure if I got a defective product but it is veryery upsetting to sit in your car for hours and not see your phone recharge.  If you need a reliable charger, DO NOT purchase this product.If you need a car charger for your Samsung S2, I would recommend the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter.  It charges fast and is dependable.",Positive
"A veryery good car charger for your phones, charged my phone pretty quickly and quite affordable, I recommend it to anyone to have as a back up to your charger.",Positive
"WHAT A GREAT PRICE!RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, PLUG N UPLOAD SUM JUICE ...DON'T KNOW IF DROPPING IT REPEATEDLY ON THE FLOORBOARD,OR OCCASIONALLY STUFFING IT IN CONSOLE TO HIDE CAUSED FAILURE ...BUT SOON THE GREEN LIGHT FAILED TO LIGHT, AND PHONES DISPLAY SHOWEDIT WASN'T CHARGING. SO EITHER SPEND SEVERAL MORE DOLLARS FOR ONE WITHA HEAVIER CORD/STRONGER SHELL OR TREAT IT AS A DELICATE FLOWER.",Positive
Sprint wanted $30 fro the same item.  This is OEM and not third party after market. Bought two.  Work great,Positive
This charger works great. I love the fact that the LED on it does not light up until it is plugged into the phone. Great bargain.,Positive
"Though I`m not a expert in cell phone chargers. This thing works good, but its not all fireworks and hotel parties. Its a charger and it works so I guess buy it.",Positive
I used this charger for a couple of months now. Its a veryery good charger. It charges my phone veryery quickly.,Positive
"good oem car charger, i originally bought it for my galaxy S2 and later on that week I upgrated to the Galaxy S3 and it works prefectly fine, I would recommend this product",Positive
This charger works perfectly.  It is the official Samsung charger so I was sure it would work just fine. I highly recommend it.,Positive
"I use this charger with my GS2 from Straight Talk.  This charger is working as expected, charges the phone fine and seems like a quality product, not flimsy and cheap feeling like some chargers I have ordered in the past.",Positive
"This thing worked well when it actually functioned, but today it stopped working and I am past the 30 day return window by 10 days give or take.I am guessing the quality might not be great as that is why it stopped working, who knows.. What a waste of money.",Positive
Hope to use it soon.  My other one worked sometimes.  This one does not have the light on unless you are charging.,Positive
"es un cable para carro de excelente calidad , original de samsung , lo tengo algun tiempo sin ningun problema",Positive
"I went thru 3 car charges which they all either stopped working after a few uses or never worked to begin with.This car harder not only works it also charges my phone lightening fast!!! LOVE IT, LOVE IT LOVE IT!!If u are debating u can rest assured this thing is awesome.",Positive
"First, this is kind of cheap-looking, but I did try to buy the cheapest OEM car charger I could for my phone, so that is forgiveable.  The springs on the side do not have much force, though, so this is constantly slipping out of the 12V car port.  The cable is sturdy, but the rubber near the connector is kind of stiff, which makes charging AND operating your phone on the go a bit of a hassle.  It is held up well since I purchased it though.UPDATE:  Stopped charging after a month.",Positive
Works great nice long cord. Does the trick. Bought several of these to put in diff. rooms & one for work.,Positive
Good charger and is perfect because it is also has a USB connection. Also love that it is original material it works like that too giving a quick charge when i need it.,Positive
It worked fine for a few days then I had to change to cord........The charger itself working fine up to this point..........Rather than send it back I bought another cord from sprint for $19.00,Positive
I thought this would be a Samsung product but look like a cheap counterfiet. It came crushed and is slow to charge my phone.,Positive
This detachable sansung galaxy s2 travel charger is simply good. It works perfectly.  The cherry on the cake is because it is longer than the factory original l received with the phone.,Positive
"First off, the charger works just as it should and all the ports stay connected just fine.People in other reviews were complaining that the cord was too short-- about 2 or 3 feet-- and that was what I was expecting. Instead, I got a 5 foot cord which is a bit long for the purpose I was going to use it for (in my car). Now I have a long cord dangling everywhere. That extra length may be a bonus for most, but I bumped down the rating due to seller is lack of description and/or consistency. Also I am fairly certain the product image was changed because when I ordered it, a different style adapter was pictured... I was expecting a square shape with the USB port on the side; I got the longer rectangle shape with the USB port on the end... hmm. There is no way to veryerify that now.In sum: Good charger with good connectivity, looks and acts like it is an original Samsung.  Cord length and adapter style may veryary as it seems like the seller is not consistent.",Positive
it is a charger for dirt cheap and the shipping was not more than the item. I wish they had the batteries i needed as well for my phone. but great all an all,Positive
This charger is exactly like the original one that came with my phone.  It is most definitely a good buy for the price!,Positive
"works good with our phones, better actually than the charger that came with one of the phones initially , great price",Positive
I have not had any problems with it.  It just like the oringal charger that comes with the Galaxy S 2.,Positive
"I would like to start off by saying that this product is what I ordered and I have no complaints about shipping or the condition of the product when it came to my house, the problem I do have is the micro usb cable that comes with the charger. Why is it that all of the different companies that sell chargers on Amazon can get the plug part of the charger right but not the micro usb cord? The cord is cheap and not the original cord that comes with the other part of the charger. I am having the same issue with the charger that I ordered for my galaxy note 2. It is a veryery thin cord, and also veryery short. Maybe, a 2 21/2 foot cord? And its of a cheaper quality than the part of the charger that the micro usb plugs into...",Positive
I love it.  It charges my phone quickly and the cord is super long.  I leave it at home but will purchase another to leave at work.,Positive
"After 2 weeks my charger just fell apart while i was taking it from the plug , not a strong charger at all i would have asked for my money but it was not even worth it .",Positive
I am pleased with this purchase.  The detachable cable option gives veryery good flexibility for use with other USB cable chargers.  Good quality for a travel charger.,Positive
charges me up all the way. doubles my battery liek promised. case protects well and the color is awesome nice,Positive
"The color is amazing all of my friends are jealous and ask me where did I get it. They are even more jealous when I tell them how much I paid for it! Great case, powers me up and VERY stylish. Matches my 5C PERFECTLY :)",Positive
much slimmer than I thought and it ads 125% battery. I am charged for the full day with this case.,Positive
"Great quality product , I love this case it is the perfect sidekick to an always dyeing phone . Now my phone is charged anywhere anytime thanks to powerbear . Really like the name of the case as well !! 5 stars deff !",Positive
"This PowerBear case is a lifesaver!! Charges fast, always reliable. I also love the glossy texture of the case. Highly recommend!!",Positive
"This is a veryery well built and designed case,with a veryery cool and attractive color. Phone dies too quickly without it",Positive
"I was surprised it game in three steps, but when i put the case together and slid my phone in, i loved it. It is hard to get off",Positive
I was looking for something different to my wife and this case its strong and beautiful. Good price and i recommend it.,Positive
"Love it this case is just what I expected and I love the design, it is slim and protects my case more than I thought it would.",Positive
"Really cute but the heart does not really show up if you have the white iPhone 4. 3 piece case & fits like a glove, looks really cute. Shipping took about 2-3 weeks but really enjoy the case. Do recommend.",Positive
Great case for my phone. Protects and keeps me charged. easy access to the button and sounds good too. i like it,Positive
Other power cases muffled the speaker sound. This one had a great sound port on the back for clear listening.,Positive
Great case. Doubled my battery life like promised. Ca not beat the price. I would recommend it for a friend. A+,Positive
"Great case, sturdy, doubles battery, wont have to worry any more. I purchased this for my kid and he is veryery HAPPY.",Positive
"Bought one for me and the wife (diff color;phone, not  wife, lol.). Firefighter work 24 hr shift and never know when if will get to recharge so this is perfect for me and anyone else that can not always plug in to charge each day.",Positive
"I used to be obsessed with changing phone cases, but now I am obsessed with THIS phone case!! What a great find !! 5 STARS",Positive
couldnt watch movies on the htc without the battery dying. the phone is great for entertainment. but battery could be better. the powerbear cases is a great fit and a good kick stand on teh back for entertainment. im sold,Positive
This product is great. I like the kickstand on the back. The power indicator is veryery convenient to know charge pack status.,Positive
Not Many HTC one battery cases for sale and this one is pretty good for the price. I would give it 4.5 stars and 5 if the price was $5 cheaper.,Positive
"I never do this, but I almost bought this product based off of the amazing sounding fake reviews provided by the shills for PowerBear. If you look at all the positive reviews for this case, you will see that none of them are veryerified purchases and yet every negative review, other than this one of course, is a veryerified purchase. What that means is that everyone who has actually bought and used this product thinks that it is crap. Furthermore, many of the reviewers have posted twice on this product, once per color. Why Amazon allows this is beyond me, but that is not the point. Also, if you look at the profiles of the positive reviewers, you will see that they have posted multiple positive reviews for PowerBear products and many of the reviews are carbon copies of each other. Beware the paid shills!",Positive
"This is absolutely amazing, more than doubles my battery life, so I can forget about carrying my charger all the time.For such a good price, this is just the right deal. A++++++++",Positive
"My brother just got the HTC One, and I promised him an awesome case like the one I have for my S4.Super sleek look, fits well, does not get overheated and saves the day every now and then! Especially when GPS is needed!",Positive
The raised edges protect the screens from falls. The battery case looks stylish and charges me up. This case is fannnnntastic,Positive
fits well on the phone and it is easy to use. the price is unbeatable and the product works like advertised,Positive
The S5 is a fantastic phone. However because of its large screen the phone dies quickly. With the extended battery I am able to enjoy all of the phones features without losing power. Great buy.,Positive
"Totally worth the money, It protects my phone in even of the most dangerous situations where I dropped my phone and it also keeps my battery going for Days. BRAVO!",Positive
"This is a really great case, looks and feels amazing, not to mention that the battery lasts for many hours.",Positive
"I think this case is an excellent choice, since it is not so bulky, the color is nice, the texture on the back is good for gripping, and it extends battery life. It is a life saver, and there is not too much on the market at the time for this phone so I am happy with it. Bought both blue and black for me and my brother right after we got home from the phone store. Would recommend.",Positive
compre este Case hace veryarios meses y protege el celular de manera excelente..ni siquiera tube que comprar protector de pantalla y gracias a dios mi cel este nuevo..,Positive
i was raving to a friend about how amazon has great phone cases and how cheap they are and bought him this. it did not even fit his phone right. poorly made.,Positive
"nice case, protective and good looking, it also has a nice changing texture in some areas. good buy for the price",Positive
"Bought this for my new AT&T; Galaxy SII, the case arrived super fast, its fits the phone perfectly and snug. I have no issues with any buttons, and the rubber is in a smooth, sort of laminated finish. It does not stick to your pockets. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, especially for so cheap.And just FYI: This is for the AT&T; (i777), or International (i9100) Galaxy SII.This WILL NOT FIT Sprint, T-Mobile or the AT&T; Galaxy SII Skyrocket phones. You have been warned.",Positive
"I liked the case, and for the amount of money paid, its a good buy, i personally like stronger cases, this is veryery flexible and indeed looks like a hard case, a little bit of more firmness wouldnt hurt.Protects VERY well the phone as well as the camera lens there is not one single part of the phone touching the surface of the table when i leave it there. Very Good purchase.",Positive
"Like most of the other reviews say, this rubbery case has a smooth exterior, so it does not feel like an uncomfortable sticky rubber.  While still appearing to have a hard shell, the rubber itself is fairly soft, and does a great job of protecting from falls without feeling too bulky.",Positive
"the case did not fit my phone; was a tad too small.  i could only get 3 corners into the case.  i wound up buying a two piece case that cost about $20 from a local store.  have dropped the phone so many times the case is beat to s***, and no damage to the phone.  good reason to buy a case, just not this one.my co-worker delayed in getting a case because he could not find one he liked, and broke the display screen, making his phone unusable.  buy a case, not this rubber thing.  i threw mine away within 5 minutes of it is arrival",Positive
This skin fits perfect in my SGSII and the phone looks great inside of it.It is a high quality skin and gives a veryery good feeling in your hands.I recommend this product for your SGSII.,Positive
Do not expect more but it works well for the reason you buy.I was looking for a cheap skin case and was not willing to pay a hefty amount for the case at least for the initial period after buying my unlocked galaxy s II.Di not Expect much before buying.But it really does work well.4 $ with 2 day shipping free is really a good deal if you are looking for a perfect tpu case protecting your phone.,Positive
Great case fit my samsung galaxy s2 great will order again fast shipping it make my phone look super sexy trust me you need to order 1.,Positive
Be careful when ordering these cases. Not all Galaxy II is are the same. Mine was a Sprint and this one did not fit my pnone. It went into the trash can as it wasnt worth sending back. Otherwise I am sure it is a great case.,Positive
"arrive on time, good quality, functionally, recomend to protect the samsung galaxy S 2 I9100, fit exactly , recomend to the owners of this smartphone .",Positive
"I was expecting a bit higher quality product but it is what it is. I have used it for a few months and it definitely helped when I dropped my phone. But at this point, I am not using it anymore due to the quality of the product, although 'good', it could be better and more solid.",Positive
"there is a different between the size/design of Galaxy II that is carried by USA and what is carried by Asia.  I am in USA, I ordered the cover for Galaxy II that i bought from USA, the cover did not fit, and the speaker location is different from the phone.  I copmared the cover to another Galaxy II that is sold in Asia and i found that the design is different.So if you bought Galaxy II from USA, do not buy cover from outside USA",Positive
"It is good, and look so cute. I like it. It is cheap than when i saw in a store.",Positive
"I made a good choice whenI thought of buying this, its veryery safe, & not to bulky! Overall veryery satisfied customer.",Positive
Very satisfied with my purchase. The quality is good and the shipping is quick. The case provides enough friction to enable a good grip on the phone. TPU (the plastic material where the case is made of) veryirtually resists oil and dust. I used to have an Otter box for my other phone. The protection is excellent BUT the silicone attracts dust like crazy. The S-Style pattern at the back is more of a personal taste - some people like it but some other may not. To me it adds some flavor to an otherwise plain black case. The protection on all 4 sides on the front panel looks sufficient (anyone dare to slam your phone on the floor to test it out?). I wish the top margin (above the earphone) can wrap down by a few mm. Overall I feel my phone secured in the case.,Positive
"totally awesome, It was made with good quality and I would purchase this again in another color it still looks new!",Positive
this case is better than i thought i love the feel and design and it is well made and doen not collect dust.,Positive
"This product arrived quickly. It fits my HTC and is easy to get on and off, I have no complaints.",Positive
this is a good product is just a usb cable it work perfect just like a oem cable. . .,Positive
"Well, went on the internet first....$14.00, then to a veryery well known store, here in Gloucester, MA, $28.  I was not happy.  Then, of course, I knew Amazon would come up with something...they did, $4.00 and change...it arrived promptly.  I cannot say enough about Amazon, they are realistic in their prices, knowing that people do not have that kind of money to pay for a wire,,for 14 or 28 dollars. I have never been so happy to get what I need without spending my last dollar for it.  Thank you again and again.",Positive
"There is a difference in USB cables.  On some computers, including mine, the USB ports are underpowered, and some poor cables do not transmit data well.  I have purchased some cheaper cables that would not transmit data between my computer and my Blackberry Storm 9530.  This cable works great, even with my underpowered USB ports.",Positive
"I bought this micro usb cable because it was cheap, and that it is. I use this with my Nexus s 4g from sprint and although it does indeed charge my device it causes some major issues, such as screen lag, my computer not being able to recognize what kind of device this is, and causing my phone to constantly jump into car mode. So if you need a real quick cable for basic charging, this will do it, anything else...spend the extra buck on a higher end cable.",Positive
"I purchased 3 of these cables because they were cheap and got good reviews.  I do not know how people are getting these cables to work... but out of the 3 I bought, 0 have functioned properly with my Palm Pre!  The best I can do is get it to charge, though the entire time it is charging the computer is complaining about ""Unknown Device"" and ""Could not install drivers"" even though it works beautifully with the original cable.  The only setting that works is ""Just Charge""!  Each of the 3 cables fails slightly differently which makes me believe that each has a different flaw!  I have tried this with my Wife is Palm Pixi as well as used different computers and that failed as well.  Look elsewhere when attempting to purchase a cable for your Palm device!",Positive
this phone cord is so easy to use and easily connected from phone to computer. great veryalue for the price.,Positive
"This cable is better than original.  Never any issues with phone recognizing USB connection, as the original does, when plugged to PC.",Positive
"A good inexpensive cable that works like the original.  I purchased this cable because I wanted one that would work with the touch stone I just purchased.  After reading several reviews and looking at competing cables I deciding on this one.  While several inches shorter (40"") than the original it works well and with the touch stone.  I used this cable mainly for use in the car.",Positive
"The cable worked great with the pre if you need an extra one, but I suggest purchasing the whole unit--plug and all, not just the cable, because with shipping and handling it gets to be the same price.",Positive
not much to say about a wall charger except it charges my bluetooth perfectly.  I am glad I bought it.  Thank you!,Positive
"The Motorola T505 does not come with an AC charger, only a DC charger. This makes a great addition to the package. You can charge in your home at night.",Positive
"I was initially leary about purchasing this item due to the extremely low price and to have free shipping also, but I needed a wall charger since Motorola only includes a car charger with their wireless car phone speakers.  So I took a chance (due to the low price and free shipping) and was pleasantly surprised.  The charger appears to as well made as the other after market chargers I purchased previously for my e-book reader, PDA, camera, etc., and at less than 25% of the cost.  I charged my Motorola speaker without any problems.",Positive
we bought this charging cord because the t505 only came with a car charger.  we now have 2 t505 with the 2nd one intended for use with connecting our bluetooth enabled phones with the home stereo.  this cord offers a convenient way to charge both as we are not in the car for long enough periods for the device to charge completely while travelling.  by bringing in the devices we are able to charge overnight to a full charge.  great price and no complaints with receipt of material in either packaging or transit time.,Positive
"It is true! This cable outperforms the original! When I charge my phone, it is chargier. The data is more datery and the phone is more phoney in general. If I wear the cable around my neck like a bolo tie, people like me better and I can run faster and jump higher.  If I circle my dinner plate with it, the food tastes better. Basically this cable makes everything better than the original. I am thinking about getting a 2nd one!",Positive
"This is clearly not a HTC cable as it has the Blackberry logo on it and the bulk packaging label says Blackberry...but it is a OEM micro usb cable none the less and works perfectly on any micro usb device I plugged it into.While I have not tested it is speed against other cables I doubt it outperforms any other OEM cable but it works and that is all I asked for of it.The cable is a bit thick and as a result is stiff but not unmanageably so.It should also be noted that the cable shown in the picture is not of the actual product, that is a mini usb cable and appears to be quite a bit longer than the product, this cable is 1m long.",Positive
"I will never understand how one review can say this item works exactly as it should and how the next complains about it not working...for the EXACT same phone! I just do not get it. I decided to try it out despite the people that said it did not work, and I am glad I did. It is exactly what I expected and wanted. I actually bought 2 of these so I could leave one in my car and one at work. For only $4 and some change for the both...this was a GREAT buy for me and now I never have to worry about my Incredible running out of battery!",Positive
I was really impressed by the price and was veryery excited when it arrived. But it does not work like it says it does. At first it charged my phone just fine but then it stopped charging; I waited a day to charge again but it still did not charge.,Positive
well bought this so i could have a spare cord since i have the original cord in my car with a usb charger there got tired of keeping track where i had it last.  so this cord works on when plugged into the wall.  when hooked to a pc phone wont stay connected to the pc to transfer files or anything.  so if you just need a cord to plug into the wall this will work but do not even think of this cord if you want to use it with a pc.,Positive
I use this cord to charge my phone in my pc at work and it works great. Does not charge super fast but charges it none the less.,Positive
this product is great veryalue for the price. and it works like it suppose to. you can not beat it. you always need extra cords.,Positive
"cable works fine with my veryerizon Galaxy S4, it charges and transmit the data fine.However, connector tip(phone side) is too thick, it will not fit if you use aftermarket cases.",Positive
"The cable is good, but it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy S4. It does plug in, but not far enough in to hold securely.",Positive
It works and is a good veryalue for the price compared to the retail stores. The only negative is that it is just a tad too short.,Positive
works great. it is always good to have backup cables and this one works great and replaced my old one.,Positive
I have purchased many chargers for my Samsung phone on amazon and honestly the quality is just so so on them.  Maybe I am just really hard on chargers but I feel like they should last more than a few months.  Spend the money and get a good quality one.,Positive
it works great and came at the right time you can never have enough chargers for every where lol thanks,Positive
"It was what I expected to be and works fine, thought it might have been a larger gauge of wire?",Positive
"Works fine IF you do not move the phone.  If you handle the phone, the plug works its way out within two or three minutes.  This despite a relatively stiff fit.  Note that the cord that came with the phone plugs in smoothly and securely.  That is my general-use cord now; this one is relegated to overnight charging where the phone is not being used.",Positive
Disappointed at how cheap they are and doubt they were designed for newer devices.  They are also veryery short.  Took a long time to ship.  Specifically purchased due to the ad saying they were for Samsung Galaxy devices.  It did not work in my S4.  They require a good charger a d one that is newer and better.,Positive
It Works perfect. It charges my phone pretty quickly and it is great that it retracts. No problems with this charger.,Positive
"This is an excellent divice, I have order several within 6 months for family and friends who wanted to take mine. Love it!",Positive
"This charger does not work veryery well. When plugged in, it shows that it is charging, but after ten minutes I am lucky to get 1% more on my battery. I only use it now if my battery is low and I want to keep it from getting lower...that is really all it is good for.",Positive
I really like this charger and not having the cord hanging around all the time when it is not necessary.  Item was received quickly and was as seller stated. The cord retracts in a snap when I am done with it. It also pulls out to whatever length so that I can just pull it out a short way to plug my phone in and the cord is not everywhere. I recommend it!,Positive
"It works, that is about all that can be said for it. It charges my Galaxy fine, but cord does not retract. Mine came with a busted spring. Cheap enough I do not care, not worth the shipping to return. It charges, I suppose that is all that matters",Positive
"love it for moving from car to car.  great for a mobile person. can pack in brief case or backpack when travel, without worry about cord hanging or wrapping.",Positive
"The charger works fine.  It was a great veryalue considering how much they cost in stores.  However, it does not retract at all.",Positive
"The plug fits and it charges my Captivate, it felt rather snug. The ""retractable""-ness of this charger is anything but. Plain ol' does not work. I literally took it out of the package, and the first time I pulled the cord out - did not yank, tug, or otherwise forcefully pull it - about 10 inches and hit the retract button to test it out and it retracted about 2 inches of it. I pulled it out further, retracted about 4 or so inches of it. Bottom line was that after messing with it and *feeding* it back into the charger veryersus it retracting itself automatically when depressing the retract button, it took a few minutes to get the plug retracted so that only a few inches of cable was still hanging out of the charger and that was the best I could get. The cable would only automatically retract 2-4 inches at any given length. The main reason I wanted this was for the ""retractability"" since I hate having cables dangling around.Working on getting a refund for this item now.",Positive
"took longer than expected to be delivered but over all satisfied with the charger. the retractable cord is just long enough to reach the cup holder in my truck where i usually put my phone. down side, ive already got 2 welps on my arm from retracting the cord! be careful! haha.",Positive
was somewhat concerned after reading some of the reviews. Price was great so I bought extras just in case. Quality seems great. Cord not quite as flimsy as expected from other comments. Love not having the cords getting tangled in car,Positive
I love the retractable feature as it hides away so nicely. I does the job just as well as a thick corded device. excellent product.,Positive
"This works just fine to recharge my Captivate. With some products, it is impossible to get a good tight connection to the phone at the USB end; this one does not have that problem.",Positive
"Item shipped and arrived veryery fast. Item is perfect for my car & phone, veryery compact. Item is as advertise.",Positive
Great I gave it to my GF and she loves it.,Positive
"I like how long the cord is with this changer so that I am able to reach the night stand and table from where I plug it in at.  However, I am not a fan of how long it seems to take to charge to full charge, nor how it atomically &#34;stops&#34; charging at certain times on it is own.",Positive
This is a veryery good charger to keep for travel and as a back up in your house. I use it frequently.,Positive
"I was veryery pleased with this item when I got it back so quickly because it was a gift. However, I cannot give a 5 star rating for a product that never worked.",Positive
"The Phone charger works, it charges the phone. However, while the phone is charging it continually beeps as when the battery is too low.It will not stop beeping while it is charging until the battery reaches a certain percentage.I do not think this is the correct charger to be using on the phone I have.Now I am worried based on other reviewers that the battery may blow on the phone and I will have to replace that too.I would not recommend buying this charger.The charger from my old blackberry works better.",Positive
"I had to replace the cord from the first one I purchased a month ago, but this one is great.",Positive
It works great. It has a longer cord than the one I got with the phone. I would recommend this item.,Positive
"When i went to take the charger out of my wallit snapped in half. Lesson learned,cheap things break too quickly.",Positive
"This power cord is a great replacement for the standard dual use cord that comes with your phone. By dual use, I mean, the standard cord that comes with your phone is a usb data cable with a dc power plug on the end. Sometimes I am using the phone and just one twist or tug of the line and the cable will disconnect from the dc power supply, which I imagine will cause the data cable to short out over time and also may ruin the battery. Phone companies just got cheap and decided to stop sending phones with a power cable AND a data cable separately, but in the end, you will go out and get yourself a standard power cable...like this one, which is just fine...quality-wise and price-wise. Yep. Oh, and this does have a big red light that comes on once you plug it into the wall, whether your phone is plugged to it or not, so if you are one of those nit picky sleepers that needs a completely dark room to sleep, you stick yourself a small piece of black electrical tape over the light, because it is brighter then you may think.",Positive
we have had it a month and it is working great. wish the cord was a little longer but it is much longer than the one you get with the phone.,Positive
"it works and it works well. i go through chargers pretty quickly so im hoping this one will hold up. so far, so good! the wire is thick and its well put together! as far as im concerned, its well worth the small amount",Positive
"Thanks for the quick delivery time. And, it actually is a quality note pad! Mom loves it, it was a replacement gift for another brand from another company that did not work, this one is awesome!",Positive
I love that this has a longer cord!  It fits great in my phone!  Very pleased you have it so cheap!  Thanks!,Positive
"Paid $0.32 for the charger and $2.81 Shipping & Handling.....Yeah, I know the shipping & handling was much more expensive than the charger was but I needed a charger that connected and this one fit nice and snug so I am able to charge my phone while sitting at my desk in my home office at my computer looking for work.....which is an all day job huh?  LOL!  Wow, I wish I could write reviews for a living would not that be nice?  I think the total price of $$3.13 was a great savings compared to how much the retailers that sell the mobile phones charge anywhere from $10-$20.  Ms_Thrifty has done it again!  Stay tune to more reviews, Oh how I love Amazon!",Positive
Gave this 4 of 5 stars because the cord is waaaaaaay too short. Works well. Charges phone quickly also. Would not buy again however.,Positive
Its a charger and it works as advertised. It also cam in the mail pretty quickly so I am satasfied with that as well.,Positive
"U can never have too many.  Bought this as a spare for purse, home and work.  Now I do not have to worry about forgetting it.",Positive
"Product came really fast, nice long cord, which was great considering factory cord is so short. Worked great til the third day, then I do not know what happened...at the price I did not expect perfection, and at Sellers defense,I have not contacted them..it could easily be my own fault and I have been so busy...even review is late. (Sorry)",Positive
Bought as gift for my relative and he loves it.....Great job...Would highly recommend this product to all customers.Thank you,Positive
"Where you mainly use your blue tooth is when you need to be hands on the wheel...driving.If your BT is down on battery charge, this is handy.  I just wish the length of the cord were longer....I already had a plug-in in the charger nearest me....!",Positive
I have used this car charger for the last 2 months. So far all is well. Nice retractable cord. It retracts at the push of a button.,Positive
works great for powering my Plantronics BT. i like the retractable cord so it doesnt have a long cord getting in the way. nice and compact and easy to store when not in use,Positive
good,Positive
"I was a bit wary about buying this headset in used condition, but was lured by the half-price price tag when compared to a new headset. I envisioned all sorts of shortcomings, but when it arrived I was astounded at the excellent condition of the headset. It is clean. No scratches. No faded labeling. It looked to be brand new. Oh yeah...it works great, too.&#128077;",Positive
"I love that this headset stays firmly on the head with the band and firmly on the ear with just the ear piece.  The sound quality is great, and the ability to mute the mic is the main reason I bought this.  The mute switch is in a convenient place and has a nice clip to attach to your shirt.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had a lot of people tell me I sound somewhat distorted when talking on it.  Usually I can make it better by adjusting the mic veryolume (another nice feature) or by moving the mic away from my mouth.  Overall good purchase for the money.",Positive
"I have been using one of these for years!  I replace it with a new one when the old one wears out.  The mic is always strong enough to pick up my veryoice, and I never have complaints about people not being able to hear me.  The ear-pad is comfy, and I occasionally forget I have this on.  The best part is the adjustable amplifier - if I have distortion from the sound out of my cell phone, I can increase or decrease both the output from the cell phone itself and the amplifier on the headset, and I usually can maximize the sound and minimize distortion.  I do not have to hold anything with my hand to get the conversation through.",Positive
