Its not user friendly.	,Negative
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.	,Negative
Then I exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem.	,Negative
This results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute.	,Negative
This PDA rocks.	,Positive
It is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtop/camera/cellphone and excels in those roles.	,Positive
I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT25,Negativev for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price!	,Positive
I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	,Positive
Pretty piece of junk.	,Negative

The noise shield is incrediable.	,Positive
No real improvement.	,Negative
Razr Battery - Good buy.	,Positive
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	,Positive
They refuse to refund or replace.	,Negative
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.	,Negative
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	,Negative
Great case and price!	,Positive
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	,Negative
Bluetooth range is good - a few days ago I left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch.	,Positive
Small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place.	,Positive
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.	,Positive
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.	,Negative
I am glad I purchased it.	,Positive
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.	,Negative
Perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when I use this.	,Negative
Don't buy this product.	,Negative

No shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch NOTHING!I couldn't be more happier with my new one for the Droid.	,Positive

All in all I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	,Positive
If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking this isn't it.	,Negative

Disapointing Results.	,Negative
Cumbersome design.	,Negative
Great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then I expected!!!!	,Positive
Great Product.	,Positive
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	,Negative

I am very happy	,Positive
I've had no trouble accessing the Internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions.	,Positive
I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying "what?"	,Negative
The battery life is highly unacceptable.	,Negative
That company is a joke.	,Negative
It does everything the description said it would.	,Positive
Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset.	,Negative
It works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	,Positive
Verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and I ended up having to do a hard re-set wiping out all my data.	,Negative
Voice Quality Signal Strength Dropped Calls.	,Negative
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however it's not.	,Positive
Better than expected.	,Positive
It feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	,Negative
Battery is holding up well.	,Positive
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.	,Negative
I only used it two days and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	,Negative

Better Than New.	,Positive
What possesed me to get this junk I have no idea...	,Negative
Piece of trash.	,Negative
A pretty good product.	,Positive
This is a great phone!.	,Positive
For the price on Amazon it is an excellent product which I would highly recommend.	,Positive
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	,Positive
The real killer is the volume and of course it breaking.	,Negative
Those phones are working just fine now.	,Positive
I am more than happy with this product.	,Positive
Poor Construction.	,Negative
This is infuriating.	,Negative
Overall I would recommend this phone over the new Walkman.	,Positive
Sprint charges for this service.	,Negative
It is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap.	,Negative

I like design and look of Jabra behing the ear headsets and 5,Negative2,Negative is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear.	,Positive
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.	,Positive
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E7,Positive5.. is the worst i have ever seeen.	,Negative
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.	,Negative
Poor product.	,Negative
However I needed some better instructions.	,Negative
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.	,Negative
Worked very well paired with a Treo 7,Negative,Negativew and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).	,Positive
Steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pens which come in a three-pack.	,Negative
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT SUCKS	,Negative
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.	,Positive
Plus I seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point.	,Negative
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.	,Positive
Very Dissapointing Performance.	,Negative
Don't make the same mistake that I did and please don't buy this phone.	,Negative
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	,Negative
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.	,Negative
I recommend iGo to anyone with different brand cell phones/mp3 players in the family.	,Positive
Don't bother - go to the store.	,Negative
I posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the Fire Red and it's a great color!	,Positive
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.	,Positive
You get what you pay for I guess.	,Negative
Not only did the software do a great job of this I could also make my own ringtones form my existing CDs without an internet connection.	,Positive
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.	,Positive
These are fabulous!	,Positive
However BT headsets are currently not good for real time games like first-person shooters since the audio delay messes me up.	,Negative
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	,Positive
Disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer.	,Negative
Performed awful -- muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call.	,Negative
Very wind-resistant.	,Positive
Obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for.	,Negative
They do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replace.Easy to operate and the sound is much better than others I have tried.	,Positive
I contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	,Negative
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	,Negative
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	,Positive
Great phone.	,Positive
When I placed my treo into the case not only was it NOT snug but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides.	,Negative
I'm pleased.	,Positive
Battery is terrible.	,Negative
I found the product to be easy to set up and use.	,Positive
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.	,Negative
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.	,Negative
The charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work.	,Negative
No ear loop needed it's tiny and the sound is great.	,Positive
Finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and I could not use it any longer on the visor.	,Negative
The handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the Treo reboots.Overall I still rate this device high.	,Positive
Talk about USELESS customer service.	,Negative
It felt too light and "tinny.".	,Negative
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	,Negative
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.	,Positive

Does everything it should and more.	,Positive
I could not recommend these more.	,Negative
Nice Sound.	,Positive
Looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment!!	,Negative
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.	,Positive
Setup went very smoothly.	,Positive
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	,Negative
A must study for anyone interested in the "worst sins" of industrial design.	,Negative
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	,Negative
It is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip.	,Positive
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	,Negative
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.	,Negative
Bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked.	,Negative
Truly awful.	,Negative
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	,Positive
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).	,Positive
And none of the tones is acceptable.	,Negative
camera color balance is AWFUL.	,Negative
This product is clearly not ready for prime time I don't care how cool it looks if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	,Negative
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	,Positive
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.	,Negative
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	,Positive
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.	,Negative
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.	,Negative
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	,Negative
Works well.	,Positive
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.	,Negative
Clear crisp sound.	,Positive
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well.	,Positive
The biggest complaint I have is the battery drains superfast.	,Negative
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.	,Negative
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	,Negative
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	,Positive
It doesn't make you look cool.	,Negative
Because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all.	,Positive
Comfortable fit - you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day.	,Positive
Also the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	,Negative
You can't beat the price on these.	,Positive
* Comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash SOS signals (seriously!	,Positive
lightweight and works well.	,Positive
So just beware.	,Negative
I love this cable - it allows me to connect any mini-USB device to my PC.	,Positive
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	,Negative
This is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up.	,Positive
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	,Negative
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.	,Positive
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.	,Negative
It lasts less than 3o minutes if I actually try to use the phone.My wife has the same phone with the same problem.	,Negative
Poor quality.	,Negative
jabra ear gels "R" the best!.	,Positive
Not worth it.	,Negative
The phone crashed completely and now I have to get it replaced.	,Negative
It quit working after I'd used it for about ,Positive8 months so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	,Positive
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac external battery wall outlet etc).	,Negative
It was a great phone.	,Positive
if you simply want a small flip phone -- look elsewhere as the extra bells & whistles are mediocre.	,Negative
Good value works fine - power via USB car or wall outlet.	,Positive
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	,Positive
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!	,Positive
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	,Negative
In the span of an hour I had two people exclaim "Whoa - is that the new phone on TV?!?	,Positive
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.	,Positive
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is ,Positive,Negative,Negative% functional.	,Positive
Other than that the leather is nice and soft; the fit is very tight; the cut out for the face is a good shape.	,Positive
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	,Positive
After receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke.	,Negative
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	,Positive
None of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears.	,Negative
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	,Positive

It is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	,Positive
disappointing.	,Negative
Blue Ant is easy to use.	,Positive
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.	,Positive

wont work right or atleast for me.	,Negative
in addition it feels &amp; looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic.	,Negative
But now that it is "out of warranty" the same problems reoccure.Bottom line... put your money somewhere else... Cingular will not support it.	,Negative
I really wanted the Plantronics 5,Positive,Negative to be the right one but it has too many issues for me.The good	,Negative

After my phone got to be about a year old it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	,Negative
I am sorry I made this purchase.	,Negative
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	,Negative
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.	,Negative
It was horrible!.	,Negative
I don't think it would hold it too securly on your belt.	,Negative
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.	,Negative
They work about 2 weeks then break.	,Negative
It is simple to use and I like it.	,Positive
It's a great tool for entertainment communication and data management.Oh be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	,Positive

Terrible.. My car will not accept this cassette.	,Negative
Product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones I was planning to use it with.	,Negative

It was a waste of my money.	,Negative
So far it has worked like a charm.	,Positive

Would recommend this item.	,Positive
It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	,Positive
Nice case feels good in your hands.	,Positive

Terrible phone holder.	,Negative
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	,Positive
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	,Positive
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.	,Negative
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.	,Negative
But despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official OEM product.	,Positive
How stupid is that?	,Negative
I can hear while I'm driving in the car and usually don't even have to put it on it's loudest setting.	,Positive
Seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors.	,Positive
